### Scikit-Learn Distributed Data Processing and Model Evaluation


This notebook shows how you can run a distributed processing job to run a Scikit-Learn script to clean, pre-process, perform feature engineering, and split the input data into train and test sets.

The dataset used is the [Census-Income KDD Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census-Income+%28KDD%29). We will select features from this dataset, clean the data, and turn the data into features that our training algorithm can use to train a binary classification model, and split the data into train and test sets.
